BOUNDING BOX WHEN IO CREATE NEW ENTITY3D AFTER MOVING ANOTHER ALREADY CREATED.
THE BUG CONSISTS IN A WEIRD TRANSLATION OF THE ALREADY CREATED BOUNDING BOXES.
FUCK THIS PROGRAM.
FUCK OPENGL.
FUCK C++.
FUCK STEVE JOBS.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

frustum culling is only avoiding drawing bounding boxes, it should skip model rendering aswell.
refactoring this in the renderer class would be the best option.
